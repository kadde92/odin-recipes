            <ul>
                <li>Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic until soft, about 5
                    minutes. Stir in red bell pepper and carrot; cook for 4 to 5 minutes. Add mushrooms; cook and stir
                    until softened, about 2 minutes.</li>
